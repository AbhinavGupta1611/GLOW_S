# GLObal river Width from Sentinel-2 (GLOW-S)

This repo contains the codes to estimate river flow widths using Sentinel-2 images. Further, it contains the codes to reproduce the results in the paper "Quantifying Global River Width Seasonality using Sentinel-2 Images" by A. R. Bhattarai1*, A. Gupta1*+ ,  and D. Feng1+ 

The GLOW-S data are publicly available through zenodo
